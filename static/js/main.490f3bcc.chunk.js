All boxes, Euclidian, geometrically smooth boxes.","Another definition of modernity: conversations can be more and more completely reconstructed with clips from other conversations taking place at the same time on the planet.","The twentieth century was the bankruptcy of the social utopia; the twenty-first will be that of the technological one.","Efforts at building social, political, and medical utopias have caused nightmares; many cures and techniques came from martial efforts.","The Web\u2019s \u201cconnectedness\u201d creates a peculiar form of informational and pseudosocial promiscuity, which makes one feel clean after Web rationing.","In most debates, people seem to be trying to convince one another; but all they can hope for is new arguments to convince themselves."],"CHARMING AND LESS CHARMING SUCKER PROBLEMS":["The most depressing aspect of the lives of the couples you watch surreptitiously arguing in restaurants is that they are almost always unaware of the true subject of argument.","It seems that it is the most unsuccessful people who give the most advice, particularly for writing and financial matters.","Rumors are only valuable when they are denied.","Over the long term, you are more likely to fool yourself than others.","There are two types of people: those who try to win and those who try to win arguments. They are never the same.","People usually apologize so they can do it again.","Mathematics is to knowledge what an artificial hand is to the real one; some amputate to replace.","Modernity inflicts a sucker narrative on activities; now we \u201cwalk for exercise,\u201d not \u201cwalk\u201d with no justification; for hidden reasons.","Social media are severely antisocial, health foods are empirically unhealthy, knowledge workers are very ignorant, and social sciences aren\u2019t scientific at all.","For so many, instead of looking for \u201ccause of death\u201d when they expire, we should be looking for \u201ccause of life\u201d when they are still around.","It is those who use others who are the most upset when someone uses them.","If someone gives you more than one reason why he wants the job, don\u2019t hire him.","Failure of second-order thinking: he tells you a secret and somehow expects you to keep it, when he just gave you evidence that he can\u2019t keep it himself.","Social networks present information about what people like; more informative if, instead, they described what they don\u2019t like.","People are so prone to overcausation that you can make the reticent turn loquacious by dropping an occasional \u201cwhy?\u201d in the conversation.","I need to keep reminding myself that a truly independent thinker may look like an accountant."],"THESEUS, OR LIVING THE PALEO LIFE":["The three most harmful addictions are heroin, carbohydrates, and a monthly salary.","My only measure of success is how much time you have to kill.","I wonder if a lion (or a cannibal) would pay a high premium for free-range humans.","If you need to listen to music while walking, don\u2019t walk; and please don\u2019t listen to music.","Men destroy each other during war; themselves during peacetime.","Sports feminize men and masculinize women.","Technology can degrade (and endanger) every aspect of a sucker\u2019s life while convincing him that it is becoming more \u201cefficient.\u201d","The difference between technology and slavery is that slaves are fully aware that they are not free.","You have a real life if and only if you do not compete with anyone in any of your pursuits.","With terminal disease, nature lets you die with abbreviated suffering; medicine lets you suffer with prolonged dying.","We are satisfied with natural (or old) objects like vistas or classical paintings but insatiable with technologies, amplifying small improvements in versions, obsessed about 2.0, caught in a mental treadmill.","Only in recent history has \u201cworking hard\u201d signaled pride rather than shame for lack of talent, finesse, and, mostly, sprezzatura.","Their idea of the sabbatical is to work six days and rest for one; my idea of the sabbatical is to work for (part of) a day and rest for six.","What they call \u201cplay\u201d (gym, travel, sports) looks like work; the harder they try, the more captive they are.","Most modern efficiencies are deferred punishment.","We are hunters; we are only truly alive in those moments when we improvise; no schedule, just small surprises and stimuli from the environment.","For everything, use boredom in place of a clock, as a biological wristwatch, though under constraints of politeness.","Decomposition, for most, starts when they leave the free, social, and uncorrupted college life for the solitary confinement of professions and nuclear families.","For a classicist, a competitive athlete is painful to look at; trying hard to become an animal rather than a man, he will never be as fast as a cheetah or as strong as an ox.","Skills that transfer: street fights, off-path hiking, seduction, broad erudition.

Caesar pontem fecit.","Every social association that is not face-to-face is injurious to your health."],"THE REPUBLIC OF LETTERS":["Writing is the art of repeating oneself without anyone noticing.","Most people write so they can remember things; I write to forget.","What they call philosophy I call literature; what they call literature I call journalism; what they call journalism I call gossip; and what they call gossip I call (generously) voyeurism.","Writers are remembered for their best work, politicians for their worst mistakes, and businessmen are almost never remembered.","Critics may appear to blame the author for not writing the book they wanted to read; but in truth they are blaming him for writing the book they wanted, but were unable, to write.","Literature is not about promoting qualities, rather, airbrushing (your) defects.","For pleasure, read one chapter by Nabokov. For punishment, two.","There is a distinction between expressive hypochondria and literature, just as there is one between self-help and philosophy.","You need to keep reminding yourself of the obvious: charm lies in the unsaid, the unwritten, and the undisplayed. It takes mastery to control silence.","No author should be considered as having failed until he starts teaching others about writing.","Hard science gives sensational results with a horribly boring process; philosophy gives boring results with a sensational process; literature gives sensational results with a sensational process; and economics gives boring results with a boring process.","A good maxim allows you to have the last word without even starting a conversation.","Just as there are authors who enjoy having written and others who enjoy writing, there are books you enjoy reading and others you enjoy having read.","A genius is someone with flaws harder to imitate than his qualities.","With regular books, read the text and skip the footnotes; with those written by academics, read the footnotes and skip the text; and with business books, skip both the text and the footnotes.","Double a man\u2019s erudition; you will halve his citations.","Losers, when commenting on the works of someone patently more impressive, feel obligated to unnecessarily bring down their subject by expressing what he is not (\u201che is not a genius, but \u2026\u201d; \u201cwhile he is no Leonardo \u2026\u201d) instead of expressing what he is.","You are alive in inverse proportion to the density of clich\xe9s in your writing.","What we call \u201cbusiness books\u201d is an eliminative category invented by bookstores for writings that have no depth, no style, no empirical rigor, and no linguistic sophistication.","Just like poets and artists, bureaucrats are born, not made; it takes normal humans extraordinary effort to keep attention on such boring tasks.","The costs of specialization: architects build to impress other architects; models are thin to impress other models; academics write to impress other academics; filmmakers try to impress other filmmakers; painters impress art dealers; but authors who write to impress book editors tend to fail.","It is a waste of emotions to answer critics; better to stay in print long after they are dead.","I can predict when an author is about to plagiarize me, and poorly so when he writes that Taleb \u201cpopularized\u201d the theory of Black Swan events.","Newspaper readers exposed to real prose are like deaf persons at a Puccini opera: they may like a thing or two while wondering, \u201cwhat\u2019s the point?\u201d","Some books cannot be summarized (real literature, poetry); some can be compressed to about ten pages; the majority to zero pages.","The exponential information age is like a verbally incontinent person: he talks more and more as fewer and fewer people listen.","What we call fiction is, when you look deep, much less fictional than nonfiction; but it is usually less imaginative.","It\u2019s much harder to write a book review for a book you\u2019ve read than for a book you haven\u2019t read.","Most so-called writers keep writing and writing with the hope to, some day, find something to say.","Today, we mostly face the choice between those who write clearly about a subject they don\u2019t understand and those who write poorly about a subject they don\u2019t understand.","The information-rich Dark Ages: in 2010, 600,000 books were published, just in English, with few memorable quotes. Circa AD zero, a handful of books were written. In spite of the few that survived, there are loads of quotes.","In the past, most were ignorant, one in a thousand were refined enough to talk to. Today, literacy is higher, but thanks to progress, the media, and finance, only one in ten thousand.","We are better at (involuntarily) doing out of the box than (voluntarily) thinking out of the box.","Half of suckerhood is not realizing that what you don\u2019t like might be loved by someone else (hence by you, later), and the reverse.","It is much less dangerous to think like a man of action than to act like a man of thought.","Literature comes alive when covering up vices, defects, weaknesses, and confusions; it dies with every trace of preaching."],"THE UNIVERSAL AND THE PARTICULAR":["What I learned on my own I still remember.","Regular minds find similarities in stories (and situations); finer minds detect differences.","To grasp the difference between Universal and Particular, consider that some dress better to impress a single, specific person than an entire crowd.","We unwittingly amplify commonalities with friends, dissimilarities with strangers, and contrasts with enemies.","Many are so unoriginal they study history to find mistakes to repeat.","There is nothing deemed harmful (in general) that cannot be beneficial in some particular instances, and nothing deemed beneficial that cannot harm you in some circumstances. The more complex the system, the weaker the notion of Universal.","The fool generalizes the particular; the nerd particularizes the general; some do both; and the wise does neither.","You want to be yourself, idiosyncratic; the collective (school, rules, jobs, technology) wants you generic to the point of castration.","True love is the complete victory of the particular over the general, and the unconditional over the conditional."],"FOOLED BY RANDOMNESS":["Unless we manipulate our surroundings, we have as little control over what and whom we think about as we do over the muscles of our hearts.","Corollary to Moore\u2019s Law: every ten years, collective wisdom degrades by half.","Never rid anyone of an illusion unless you can replace it in his mind with another illusion. (But don\u2019t work too hard on it; the replacement illusion does not even have to be more convincing than the initial one.)","The tragedy is that much of what you think is random is in your control and, what\u2019s worse, the opposite.","The fool views himself as more unique and others more generic; the wise views himself as more generic and others more unique.","What made medicine fool people for so long was that its successes were prominently displayed and its mistakes (literally) buried.","The sucker\u2019s trap is when you focus on what you know and what others don\u2019t know, rather than the reverse.","Medieval man was a cog in a wheel he did not understand; modern man is a cog in a complicated system he thinks he understands.","The calamity of the information age is that the toxicity of data increases much faster than its benefits.","The role of the media is best seen in the journey from Cato the Elder to a modern politician.* Do some extrapolation if you want to be scared.","Mental clarity is the child of courage, not the other way around. Most info-Web-media-newspaper types have a hard time swallowing the idea that knowledge is reached (mostly) by removing junk from people\u2019s heads.","Finer men tolerate others\u2019 small inconsistencies though not the large ones; the weak tolerate others\u2019 large inconsistencies though not small ones.","Randomness is indistinguishable from complicated, undetected, and undetectable order; but order itself is indistinguishable from artful randomness."],"AESTHETICS":["Art is a one-sided conversation with the unobserved.","The genius of Beno\xeet Mandelbrot is in achieving aesthetic simplicity without having recourse to smoothness.","Beauty is enhanced by unashamed irregularities; magnificence by a fa\xe7ade of blunder.","To understand \u201cprogress\u201d: all places we call ugly are both man-made and modern (Newark), never natural or historical (Rome).","We love imperfection, the right kind of imperfection; we pay up for original art and typo-laden first editions.","Most people need to wait for another person to say \u201cthis is beautiful art\u201d to say \u201cthis is beautiful art\u201d; some need to wait for two or more.","Almutanabbi boasted that he was the greatest of all Arab poets, but he said so in the greatest of all Arab poems.","Wit seduces by signaling intelligence without nerdiness.","In classical renderings of prominent figures, males are lean and females are plump; in modern photographs, the opposite.","Just as no monkey is as good-looking as the ugliest of humans, no academic is worthier than the worst of the creators.","If you want to annoy a poet, explain his poetry."],"ETHICS":["If you find any reason why you and someone are friends, you are not friends.","My biggest problem with modernity may lie in the growing separation of the ethical and the legal.","Life\u2019s beauty: the kindest act toward you in your life may come from an outsider not interested in reciprocation.","We are most motivated to help those who need us the least.","To value a person, consider the difference between how impressive he or she was at the first encounter and the most recent one.","Meditation is a way to be narcissistic without hurting anyone.","True humility is when you can surprise yourself more than others; the rest is either shyness or good marketing.","We find it to be in extremely bad taste for individuals to boast of their accomplishments; but when countries do so we call it \u201cnational pride.\u201d","You can only convince people who think they can benefit from being convinced.","Greatness starts with the replacement of hatred with polite disdain.","Trust people who make a living lying down or standing up more than those who do so sitting down. The tragedy of virtue is that the more obvious, boring, unoriginal, and sermonizing the proverb, the harder it is to implement.","Even the cheapest misers can be generous with advice.","If you lie to me, keep lying; don\u2019t hurt me by suddenly telling the truth.","Don\u2019t trust a man who needs an income\u2014except if it is minimum wage.","You may outlive your strength, never your wisdom.","Weak men act to satisfy their needs, stronger men their duties.","Religions and ethics have evolved from promising heaven if you do good, to promising heaven while you do good, to making you promise to do good.","Avoid calling heroes those who had no other choice.","There are those who will thank you for what you gave them and others who will blame you for what you did not give them.","Ethical man accords his profession to his beliefs, instead of according his beliefs to his profession. This has been rarer and rarer since the Middle Ages.","I trust everyone except those who tell me they are trustworthy.","People often need to suspend their self-promotion, and have someone in their lives they do not need to impress. This explains dog ownership.","Pure generosity is when you help the ingrate.

This explains why deficits tend to be larger, rarely smaller, than planned."],"THE LUDIC FALLACY AND DOMAIN DEPENDENCE":["Sports are commoditized and, alas, prostituted randomness.","When you beat up someone physically, you get exercise and stress relief; when you assault him verbally on the Internet, you just harm yourself. Just as smooth surfaces, competitive sports, and specialized work fossilize mind and body, competitive academia fossilizes the soul.","They agree that chess training only improves chess skills but disagree that classroom training (almost) only improves classroom skills.","Upon arriving at the hotel in Dubai, the businessman had a porter carry his luggage; I later saw him lifting free weights in the gym.","Games were created to give nonheroes the illusion of winning. In real life, you don\u2019t know who really won or lost (except too late), but you can tell who is heroic and who is not.","I suspect that IQ, SAT, and school grades are tests designed by nerds so they can get high scores in order to call each other intelligent.","They read Gibbon\u2019s Decline and Fall on an eReader but refuse to drink Ch\xe2teau Lynch-Bages in a Styrofoam cup.","My best example of the domain dependence of our minds, from my recent visit to Paris: at lunch in a French restaurant, my friends ate the salmon and threw away the skin; at dinner, at a sushi bar, the very same friends ate the skin and threw away the salmon.","Fragility: we have been progressively separating human courage from warfare, allowing wimps with computer skills to kill people without the slightest risk to their lives."],"EPISTEMOLOGY AND SUBTRACTIVE KNOWLEDGE":["Since Plato, Western thought and the theory of knowledge have focused on the notions of True-False; as commendable as it was, it is high time to shift the concern to Robust-Fragile, and social epistemology to the more serious problem of Sucker-Nonsucker.","The problem of knowledge is that there are many more books on birds written by ornithologists than books on birds written by birds and books on ornithologists written by birds.","The perfect sucker understands that pigs can stare at pearls but doesn\u2019t realize he can be in an analog situation.","It takes extraordinary wisdom and self-control to accept that many things have a logic we do not understand that is smarter than our own.","Knowledge is subtractive, not additive\u2014what we subtract (reduction by what does not work, what not to do), not what we add (what to do).","They think that intelligence is about noticing things that are relevant (detecting patterns); in a complex world, intelligence consists in ignoring things that are irrelevant (avoiding false patterns).","Happiness; we don\u2019t know what it means, how to measure it, or how to reach it, but we know extremely well how to avoid unhappiness.","The imagination of the genius vastly surpasses his intellect; the intellect of the academic vastly surpasses his imagination.","The ideal trivium education, and the least harmful one to society and pupils, would be mathematics, logic, and Latin; a double dose of Latin authors to compensate for the severe loss of wisdom that comes from mathematics; just enough mathematics and logic to control verbiage and rhetoric.","The four most influential moderns: Darwin, Marx, Freud, and (the productive) Einstein were scholars but not academics. It has always been hard to do genuine\u2014and nonperishable\u2014work within institutions."],"THE SCANDAL OF PREDICTION":["A prophet is not someone with special visions, just someone blind to most of what others see.","For the ancients, forecasting historical events was an insult to the God(s); for me, it is an insult to man\u2014that is, for some, to science.","The ancients knew very well that the only way to understand events was to cause them.","Anyone voicing a forecast or expressing an opinion without something at risk has some element of phoniness. Unless he risks going down with the ship this would be like watching an adventure movie.","They would take forecasting more seriously if it were pointed out to them that in Semitic languages the words for forecast and \u201cprophecy\u201d are the same.","For Seneca, the Stoic sage should withdraw from public efforts when unheeded and the state is corrupt beyond repair. It is wiser to wait for self-destruction."],"BEING A PHILOSOPHER AND MANAGING TO REMAIN ONE":["To become a philosopher, start by walking very slowly.","Real mathematicians understand completeness, real philosophers understand incompleteness, the rest don\u2019t formally understand anything.","In twenty-five centuries, no human came along with the brilliance, depth, elegance, wit, and imagination to match Plato\u2014to protect us from his legacy.","Why do I have an obsessive Plato problem? Most people need to surpass their predecessors; Plato managed to surpass all his successors.","To be a philosopher is to know through long walks, by reasoning, and reasoning only, a priori, what others can only potentially learn from their mistakes, crises, accidents, and bankruptcies\u2014that is, a posteriori.","Engineers can compute but not define, mathematicians can define but not compute, economists can neither define nor compute.","Something finite but with unknown upper bounds is epistemically equivalent to something infinite. This is epistemic infinity.","Conscious ignorance, if you can practice it, expands your world; it can make things infinite.","For the classics, philosophical insight was the product of a life of leisure; for me, a life of leisure is the product of philosophical insight.","It takes a lot of intellect and confidence to accept that what makes sense doesn\u2019t really make sense.","A theological Procrustean bed: for the Orthodox since Gregory Palamas and for the Arabs since Algazel, attempts to define God using the language of philosophical universals were a rationalistic mistake. I am still waiting for a modern to take notice.","Saying \u201cthe mathematics of uncertainty\u201d is like saying \u201cthe chastity of sex\u201d\u2014what is mathematized is no longer uncertain, and vice versa.","Sadly, we learn the most from fools, economists, and other reverse role models, yet we pay them back with the worst ingratitude.","In Plato\u2019s Protagoras, Socrates contrasts philosophy as the collaborative search for truth with the sophist\u2019s use of rhetoric to gain the upper hand in argument for fame and money. Twenty-five centuries later, this is exactly the salaried researcher and the modern tenure-loving academic.

Alas, it never hit both sides that both markets and models are very stupid.","Economics is like a dead star that still seems to produce light; but you know it is dead.","Suckers think that you cure greed with money, addiction with substances, expert problems with experts, banking with bankers, economics with economists, and debt crises with debt spending.","You can be certain that the head of a corporation has a lot to worry about when he announces publicly that \u201cthere is nothing to worry about.\u201d","The stock market, in brief: participants are calmly waiting in line to be slaughtered while thinking it is for a Broadway show.","The main difference between government bailouts and smoking is that in some rare cases the statement \u201cthis is my last cigarette\u201d holds true.","What makes us fragile is that institutions cannot have the same virtues (honor, truthfulness, courage, loyalty, tenacity) as individuals.","The worst damage has been caused by competent people trying to do good; the best improvements have been brought by incompetent ones not trying to do good.","The difference between banks and the Mafia: banks have better legal-regulatory expertise, but the Mafia understands public opinion.","\u201cIt is much easier to scam people for billions than for just millions.\u201d","At a panel in Moscow, I watched the economist Edmund Phelps, who got the \u201cNobel\u201d for writings no one reads, theories no one uses, and lectures no one understands.","One of the failures of \u201cscientific approximation\u201d in the nonlinear domain comes from the inconvenient fact that the average of expectations is different from the expectation of averages.","Journalists as reverse aphorists: my statement \u201cyou need skills to get a BMW, skills plus luck to become a Warren Buffett\u201d was summarized as \u201cTaleb says Buffett has no skills.\u201d","The curious mind embraces science; the gifted and sensitive, the arts; the practical, business; the leftover becomes an economist.","Public companies, like human cells, are programmed for apoptosis, suicide through debt and hidden risks.
